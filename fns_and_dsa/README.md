0. Arithmetic Operations Function
mandatory
Create a Python script named arithmetic_operations.py. In this script, define a function that performs basic arithmetic operations. This function, perform_operation, will be imported and used in a separate main.py script, which we provide.

Requirements for arithmetic_operations.py:

Function Definition:
Define a function named perform_operation.
Parameters: num1 (float), num2 (float), and operation (string). The operation parameter accepts four possible values: 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'.
The function should execute the arithmetic operation based on the operation parameter and the numerical values provided.
For division, include handling for division by zero, returning a specific message or value that your main.py script can recognize and display appropriately.
Return the result of the arithmetic operation.
Provided main.py for Testing:













1. Shopping List Manager
mandatory
Objective: Utilize Python lists to create a simple shopping list manager that allows users to add items, view the current list, and remove items.

Task Description:

Create a Python script named shopping_list_manager.py that implements a simple interface for managing a shopping list. This task focuses on using lists to store and manipulate data dynamically.

Requirements:

Core Functionality:

Your script should start with an empty list named shopping_list.
Implement functionality to add items to the list, remove items, and display the current list.
User Interface:

Use a loop to continuously display a menu with options to the user until they choose to exit. The menu should offer options to add an item, remove an item, view the list, and exit.
For adding items, prompt the user for the item name and append it to shopping_list.
For removing items, ask the user for the item name and remove it from shopping_list. If the item is not found, display a message indicating so.
To view the list, print each item in shopping_list to the console.
Ensure your script handles invalid menu choices gracefully.

2. Explore `datetime` Module
mandatory
Objective: Familiarize yourself with Python’s datetime module by writing a script that performs specified operations with dates and times.

Task Instructions:

Your task is to create a Python script named explore_datetime.py. This script will demonstrate your ability to use the datetime module for handling dates and times in Python.

Part 1: Display the Current Date and Time

Research how to use the datetime module to obtain the current date and time.
Create a function with a name display_current_datetime and
save the current date inside a current_date variable
Format and print the current date and time in a readable format, such as “YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS”.
Part 2: Calculate a Future Date

Prompt the user to enter a number of days (as an integer).
Create a function with a name calculate_future_date and
saves the future date inside a future_date variable
Calculate what the date will be after adding the specified number of days to the current date.
Print the future date in a format like “YYYY-MM-DD”.
Guidance:

Start by importing the necessary components from the datetime module.
Look into the datetime.now() function to get the current date and time.
Use timedelta(days=number_of_days) to represent the duration to add to the current date.
Remember, Python’s official documentation is an excellent resource for learning how to use the standard library modules.







3. Temperature Conversion Tool
mandatory
Objective: Illustrate the concept of variable scope by creating a script that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, using global variables to store conversion factors.

Task Description:

Create a Python script named temp_conversion_tool.py. This script will define functions to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, demonstrating the use of global variables to store conversion factors that are accessible within functions.

Requirements:

Define Global Conversion Factors:

At the top of your script, define two global variables FAHRENHEIT_TO_CELSIUS_FACTOR and CELSIUS_TO_FAHRENHEIT_FACTOR to store the conversion factors (e.g., (5/9) for F to C and (9/5) for C to F, respectively).
Implement Conversion Functions:

Write a function convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit) that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit and returns the temperature converted to Celsius.
Write a function convert_to_fahrenheit(celsius) that takes a temperature in Celsius and returns the temperature converted to Fahrenheit.
Inside each function, use the respective global conversion factor to perform the conversion.
User Interaction:

Prompt the user to enter a temperature and specify whether it’s in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
Based on the user’s input, call the appropriate conversion function and display the converted temperature.
If gthe user entered a wrong input,raise an error “Invalid temperature. Please enter a numeric value.”
Guidance:

Remember to access global variables using the global keyword if you need to modify them inside functions. However, for this task, you’ll only be reading their values.
Use input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid temperature and unit.
